## [Getting Started]

- include gifs here
- Include relevant steps to run exercise files or start the app
- "Open the file located at exercise-repo-name/whatever in VS Code"

- Also, include instructions on how to open their terminal in 

- WHILE DOING THIS, LOOK OUT FOR ANY POTENTIAL WINDOWS FILE PATH ISSUES in exercises


## Exercise overview

Give quick overview about context of exercises and their intention


## Specific exercises listed in numbered order

Add disclaimer if exercises are stored inside of specific files as comments

Also, for a plain text reference, theres always the `EXERCISE-INSTRUCTIONS` files to pop open

To answer questions that don't require coding, please create a file in the repo named

### Summary of JavaScript Concepts Covered in These Exercises

1. **Document Object Model (DOM) Manipulation**:
    
    - Accessing and modifying elements using methods like `getElementById`, `querySelector`, and `querySelectorAll`.
    - Navigating the DOM tree using properties like `parentNode`, `childNodes`, `firstChild`, and `lastChild`.
    - Updating the content and attributes of elements using `innerHTML`, `textContent`, and `setAttribute`.
2. **Event Handling**:
    
    - Adding event listeners with `addEventListener` and removing them with `removeEventListener`.
    - Handling various events such as clicks, mouse movements, and key presses.
    - Understanding event propagation, event bubbling, and stopping event propagation.
3. **Debugging and Performance**:
    
    - Using `console.log` for debugging.
    - Understanding the performance impact of certain DOM manipulations and optimizing code.
4. **Advanced DOM Manipulations**:
    
    - Creating and appending new elements using `createElement` and `appendChild`.
    - Removing elements from the DOM with `remove`.
    - Using class manipulation methods like `classList.add`, `classList.remove`, and `classList.toggle`.
5. **Preventing Default Behaviors**:
    
    - Preventing default actions of HTML elements using `preventDefault`.
6. **Drag and Drop Functionality**:
    
    - Implementing basic drag and drop features with event listeners for `dragstart`, `dragover`, and `drop`.
    - Using `dataTransfer` to pass data between drag and drop events.
